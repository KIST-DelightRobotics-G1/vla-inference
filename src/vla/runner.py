"""The VLA runner: cameras + robot state -> GR00T inference -> 50 Hz stream.

The end-to-end assembly of the stage pipeline — everything else in vla/ is
a stage, this is the wiring:

    io          ColorSubscriber per checkpoint view + UnitreeStateReader,
                all on ONE DomainParticipant
    observation ObservationBuilder — fresh snapshots or nothing
    policy      SonicPolicy — Observation -> 40-step ActionChunk (~135 ms)
    chunking    ChunkCursor — the seam between the two clocks
    publisher   LatentActionStreamer — 50 Hz onto rt/kist/latent_action

Two loops: the streamer's 50 Hz Tx thread (its own), and THIS main thread
running inference back-to-back — every prediction is pushed with the ticks
it spent in flight already skipped, so the cursor splices it in at "now".
No inference throttle: a faster GPU simply replaces chunks more often, and
the horizon (0.78 s) rides out the slow moments. Ctrl+C stops the stream;
gearsonic's LOST recovery brings the robot to the safe standing pose.

Which cameras exist is not configured here: the checkpoint's modality
config names its views, and `cameras` only maps view names to
ext-sensor-io camera names — a 1-view checkpoint runs one subscriber, the
3-view one runs three.
